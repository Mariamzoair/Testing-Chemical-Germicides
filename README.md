# Testing Chemical Germicides, Disinfectants/Antiseptics, and Antibiotics Using the Disc-Diffusion Assay

This repository documents a microbiological experiment evaluating the effectiveness of various antimicrobial agents—including chemical disinfectants, antiseptics, and antibiotics—on two bacterial strains: *Escherichia coli* (Gram-negative) and *Staphylococcus aureus* (Gram-positive). The disc-diffusion assay method was employed to measure bacterial inhibition and resistance.

## Objective

To assess and compare the antimicrobial effectiveness of various chemical agents and antibiotics on *E. coli* and *S. aureus* using the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method. The zone of inhibition was measured to determine sensitivity or resistance of each organism to the applied agents.

## Materials Used

- Complex agar plates (6 total)
- Nutrient agar cultures of *E. coli* and *S. aureus*
- Broth tubes, inoculating loop, cotton swabs
- Sterile paper discs
- Common antiseptics: iodine, detergent, soap, lysol wipes
- Disinfectants: hydrogen peroxide, bleach, alcohol, water
- Antibiotics: Nalidixic acid (NA30), Penicillin (P10), Gentamicin (GM10), Amoxicillin (AM10), Tetracycline (Te30), Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (Amc30)
- Flame sterilizer, tweezers, pipette, markers

## Procedure Summary

1. Prepared broth cultures of *E. coli* and *S. aureus* from nutrient agar plates.
2. Evenly inoculated agar plates with bacteria using sterile cotton swabs (vertical and horizontal strokes).
3. Placed sterile paper discs on agar surface, applying one drop of each test substance.
4. Incubated plates and measured diameter of zones of inhibition around each disc to determine effectiveness.
5. Classified each substance as either **sensitive** or **resistant** based on zone size.

## Discussion

- *Staphylococcus aureus* (Gram-positive) generally showed greater sensitivity to antibiotics than *E. coli* (Gram-negative), especially Penicillin.
- *E. coli*, due to its outer membrane structure, was more resistant to certain antiseptics and antibiotics.
- Water was used as a control and produced no inhibition in either bacteria.
- Hydrogen peroxide and bleach showed high effectiveness against both organisms.
- Some natural or household substances (e.g., soap, urine) had minimal or no effect on *E. coli*.
- Larger zones of inhibition indicate greater antimicrobial effectiveness.

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrated variability in bacterial susceptibility to chemical agents and antibiotics. *E. coli*, as a Gram-negative organism, exhibited higher resistance compared to *S. aureus*. The disc-diffusion assay provides a reliable visual method to assess antibacterial potency and can help inform antimicrobial usage in both clinical and non-clinical settings.

Effective substances like hydrogen peroxide, bleach, and certain antibiotics (e.g., Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) showed clear zones of inhibition, confirming their potential in controlling bacterial growth. This emphasizes the importance of choosing the correct antimicrobial agent based on the target pathogen's characteristics.
